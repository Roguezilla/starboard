# starboard
**starboard** can currently archive:
 - discord messages
 - uploaded images, gifs and videos
 - instagram
 - reddit  
 - twitter
 - imgur
 - pixiv
 - deviantart
 - tumblr
 - youtube
 - and others  

and can embed intagram(when discord embeds break, off by default) and reddit(more of a quality of life addition as reddit embeds by discord are pretty awful, on by default) 

first thing you have do is install the requirements:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
after installing the requirements run the bot to begin the setup:  
```bash
python main.py
```

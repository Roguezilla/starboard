and can embed intagram(when discord embeds break, off by default) and reddit(more of a quality of life addition as reddit embeds by discord are pretty awful, on by default) 

first thing you have do is install the requirements:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
after installing the requirements run the bot to begin the setup:  
```bash
